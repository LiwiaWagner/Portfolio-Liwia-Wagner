        paragraph: `I conducted Data Experience (DX) research and took the lead in
          designing and prototyping a business application specifically
          aimed at optimizing clients' supply chain networks. This involved
          thoroughly analyzing data patterns, identifying key bottlenecks,
          and ensuring the application catered to the unique logistical
          needs of each client. Through a combination of advanced data
          visualization techniques and user-centered design, I created a
          tool that improved efficiency, enhanced decision-making, and
          streamlined operations across various stages of the supply chain.`,

        title: "THE PROBLEM",
        paragraph: `The client's reporting solution had not been updated or analyzed
          for user experience since its launch over two years ago. As a
          result, the design had likely fallen behind evolving user needs
          and modern usability standards. Without regular assessments,
          potential usability issues, inefficiencies, and areas for
          improvement had gone unnoticed, affecting the tool's overall
          effectiveness and user satisfaction. Additionally, the system had
          not taken advantage of newer design trends, technologies, or
          updated user interaction patterns during that time.`,

        title: "THE GOAL",
        paragraph: `The primary objective of the project was to gain a comprehensive
          understanding of the user experience and subsequently redesign the
          existing reporting solution informed by user feedback. This
          involved conducting detailed user research, including interviews
          and usability testing, to gather insights into how users
          interacted with the current system. Based on this feedback, we
          aimed to identify pain points and areas for improvement, ensuring
          that the redesigned solution would effectively address user needs
          and enhance overall satisfaction. The ultimate goal was to create
          a more intuitive and efficient reporting tool that aligned with
          users' expectations and facilitated better decision-making.`,

        title: "THE PRODUCT",
        paragraph:
          "The final outcome of this project was an automatically refreshed Tableau dashboard that enabled the business to effectively track and monitor CO2 emissions generated by business travel. This dashboard provided real-time insights into emission trends, helping the organization identify key contributors and areas for improvement. To support this, I developed a PostgreSQL database that structured the necessary data for analysis and reporting. Additionally, I built a comprehensive data model that streamlined data processing, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. This model allowed for easy integration of new data, and the system was designed for scalability, enabling the company to track emissions year over year and make data-driven decisions for their sustainability initiatives.",

        title: "THE PROBLEM",
        paragraph:
          "The previous version of the product was an Excel-based report, which required a significant amount of manual work to prepare and clean the data before generating the CO2e report. Each month, new datasets had to be added manually, which made the entire process time-consuming and prone to human error. There was also a need to manually refresh the data to ensure the report reflected the most up-to-date information. This not only slowed down the reporting process but also introduced the risk of inconsistencies or outdated data being used for decision-making. Furthermore, the report itself was quite basic in terms of data visualization. It contained only two tables, which offered a limited view of the data and lacked the depth required to identify key patterns or trends. As a result, users were unable to extract the insights they needed to make informed, strategic decisions for reducing carbon emissions. The lack of advanced visualizations and actionable insights made it difficult for the business to effectively track progress, identify areas for improvement, and develop targeted strategies for achieving sustainability goals.",

        paragraph:
          "The goal was to create advanced visualizations and actionable insights that would enable the business to effectively track progress, pinpoint areas for improvement, and develop targeted strategies for achieving sustainability goals. By enhancing the data presentation, the aim was to move beyond basic reporting and provide a more dynamic and comprehensive view of the company's carbon emissions. This would empower decision-makers to identify trends, monitor performance over time, and make informed choices to reduce the environmental impact of business travel. Ultimately, the objective was to create a solution that not only improved efficiency but also supported the company’s broader sustainability efforts through data-driven insights.",
